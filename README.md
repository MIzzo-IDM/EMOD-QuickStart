## EMOD Quick Start

Flat files for running EMOD simulations using Excel or provided batch files.

The setenv.cmd script in this set of files will temporarily modify the PATH and
PYTHONPATH (and PYTHON_PATH which is sometimes used by the EMOD software) to
allow the EMOD software and associated scripts to run without requiring an
installation of the Visual C++ runtimes, MPI implementation, and Python.
